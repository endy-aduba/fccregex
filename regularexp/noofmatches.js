//Specify Upper and Lower Number of Matches
/*
Recall that you use the plus sign + to look for one or more characters and the asterisk * to look for zero or more characters. These are convenient but sometimes you want to match a certain range of patterns.

You can specify the lower and upper number of patterns with quantity specifiers. Quantity specifiers are used with curly brackets ({ and }). You put two numbers between the curly brackets - for the lower and upper number of patterns.

For example, to match only the letter a appearing between 3 and 5 times in the string "ah", your regex would be /a{3,5}h/.
*/

let A4 = "aaaah";
let A2 = "aah";
let multipleA = /a{3,5}h/;
multipleA.test(A4); // Returns true
multipleA.test(A2); // Returns false


//You can specify the lower and upper number of patterns with quantity specifiers using curly brackets. Sometimes you only want to specify the lower number of patterns with no upper limit.

/*
You can specify the lower and upper number of patterns with quantity specifiers using curly brackets. Sometimes you only want a specific number of matches.

To specify a certain number of patterns, just have that one number between the curly brackets.

For example, to match only the word "hah" with the letter a 3 times, your regex would be /ha{3}h/.
